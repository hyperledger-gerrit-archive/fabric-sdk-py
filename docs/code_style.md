# Python Coding Style

In order to make the code more maintainable, and helps developers understand code in reviews, we have a set of style guidelines for clarity.

* Please read [pep8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) before you try to contribute any code. The guidelines gives some basic coding conventions, including:
    - Code lay-out
    - String Quotes
    - Naming Conventions
    - Comments

* Some general guidelines you should follow like following when you write SDK code:
    - Use only UNIX style newlines (\n), not Windows style (\r\n)
    - It is preferred to wrap long lines in parentheses and not a backslash for line continuation.
    - Do not import more than one module per line
    - Docstrings should not start with a space.
    - Multi line docstrings should end on a new line.
    - Multi line docstrings should start without a leading new line.
    - Multi line docstrings should start with a one line summary followed by an empty line.

* For every api which will be used by our client, the api Docstrings are mandatory. The Google style guide contains an excellent Python style guide, we should follow. For example:

```
def square_root(n):
    """Calculate the square root of a number.

    Args:
        n: the number to get the square root of.
    Returns:
        the square root of n.
    Raises:
        TypeError: if n is not a number.
        ValueError: if n is negative.

    """
    pass
```

To extend this style to also include type information in the arguments, for example:

```
def add_value(self, value):
    """Add a new value.

    Args:
        value (str): the value to add.
    """
    pass
```
